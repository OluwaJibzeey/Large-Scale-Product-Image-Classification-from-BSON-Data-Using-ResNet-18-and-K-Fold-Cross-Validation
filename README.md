# Large-Scale-Product-Image-Classification-from-BSON-Data-Using-ResNet-18-and-K-Fold-Cross-Validation
# Product Image Classification from BSON Data

## Overview
This project implements a **multi-class product image classification** system using a **pretrained ResNet-18** model.  
The dataset is stored in **BSON format**, commonly used for large-scale image datasets, and the model is trained using **5-fold cross-validation** to ensure robustness.

The goal is to predict the correct **product category ID** for each image.
